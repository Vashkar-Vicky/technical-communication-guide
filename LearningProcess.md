# 1: What is the Feynman Technique?
The Feynman Technique is a method that involves explaining a concept in simple terms, as though teaching it to someone else, to deepen understanding and reveal gaps in knowledge.

# 2: Insights from Barbara Oakley's "Learning How to Learn" TED Talk
In Barbara Oakley's TED Talk, the most intriguing idea is the contrast between "focused mode" and "diffused mode" thinking, where focused mode allows for concentrated attention on specific tasks, while diffused mode enables broader, relaxed thinking for creative problem-solving. This concept emphasizes that both modes are essential in learning, as switching between them can help grasp complex topics and solve problems effectively.

# 3: What are Active and Diffused Modes of Thinking?
Active Mode (Focused Mode): This is a highly concentrated mental state used for solving familiar problems or working on specific tasks. It involves intense focus on one subject at a time.
Diffused Mode: This is a more relaxed mental state that allows for free-flowing thoughts, making it easier to connect different ideas. It's particularly useful for brainstorming and understanding complex problems by making broader connections.

# 4: Steps to Approach a New Topic ("Learn Anything in 20 Hours")
According to Josh Kaufman's "Learn Anything in 20 Hours," the essential steps when approaching a new topic include:

- Break down the skill into smaller components.
- Learn enough to self-correct.
- Remove practice barriers.
- Commit to practising for at least 20 hours.

# 5: Actions to Improve the Learning Process
To enhance the learning process, several actions can be taken:

- Use the Feynman Technique: Regularly practice explaining concepts in simple language. This can reveal gaps in understanding and encourage deeper learning.
- Adopt Deep Work Principles: Minimize distractions by placing phones on silent, limiting non-work notifications, and using productivity tools like TimeLimit or Freedom during focused work hours.
- Engage in Both Active and diffuse thinking: Switch between focused work and relaxed breaks to foster both intensive and creative thinking, allowing time for ideas to connect organically.
- Time Tracking and Self-Reflection: Use time-tracking apps like Boosted to monitor productivity and reflect on learning habits.
- Set Clear Goals and Deadlines: Define specific milestones for projects and assignments, and set realistic deadlines for completion. This helps allocate adequate time and builds a structured learning schedule.
