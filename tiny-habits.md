# Question 1
## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea in BJ Fogg's video was how he broke down habit formation into tiny, manageable actions that fit seamlessly into daily life. The story of how people can start with something as simple as flossing one tooth or doing two pushups after a routine task exemplified the power of starting small. This approach highlights that success comes from consistency and simplicity rather than the magnitude of the initial step.

# Question 2
## How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?

The B = MAP model (Behavior = Motivation, Ability, and Prompt) shows that for a behavior to occur, three elements must converge:

M (Motivation): The desire to perform the behavior.
A (Ability): The capacity to do it easily.
P (Prompt): The cue or trigger to initiate the behavior.
To make new habits easier, align these elements by choosing habits that are easy to do (high Ability), setting a clear and consistent Prompt, and making sure the motivation is sufficient for starting. Simplifying the habit (reducing barriers) enhances the likelihood of its repetition.

# Question 3
## Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

Celebrating after completing a habit is crucial because it creates a positive emotional response that reinforces the habit loop. This concept is vital because whatever we celebrate becomes more deeply ingrained as a habit. The act of celebrating signals to the brain that the behavior is valuable and worth repeating, strengthening the habit through an association with positive feelings.

# Question 4
## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most compelling idea from the "1% Better Every Day" video was the concept of incremental progress and how small, consistent improvements compound over time to yield significant results. The story of the British cycling teamâ€™s dramatic success by focusing on tiny improvements in multiple areas illustrated how even minor changes can lead to exceptional outcomes when sustained over time.

# Question 5
## What is the book's perspective about Identity?

"Atomic Habits" emphasizes that the most effective way to build lasting habits is to focus on identity-based habits. This means instead of concentrating solely on outcomes or processes, one should adopt an identity aligned with the desired habits. For example, instead of saying, "I want to run a marathon," shift to "I am a runner." This change reinforces behaviors that align with this identity, making the habits more resilient and enduring.

# Question 6
## Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.

To make a habit easier, "Atomic Habits" suggests applying the principle of the Law of Least Effort, which states that behaviors are more likely to be adopted if they are simple and convenient. Strategies include reducing friction (e.g., laying out gym clothes the night before) and breaking down the habit into its smallest, actionable steps. This approach lowers the barrier to entry and increases the likelihood of the habit being performed consistently.

# Question 7
## Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.

To make an undesirable habit harder to do, the book advises increasing friction or adding obstacles to the behavior. This can involve actions like removing triggers (e.g., keeping junk food out of the house), setting up physical barriers (e.g., moving apps to different screens), or incorporating effortful steps that disrupt the habit's automatic nature. By making the habit less convenient, the urge to follow through is diminished.

# Question 8
## Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

I would like to read more books. To make this habit more consistent, I will:

- **Make the cue obvious:** Place a book on my desk or near my bed as a visual reminder.
- **Make it attractive:** Choose books that interest me and reward myself with a relaxing break afterward.
- **Make it easy:** Start with reading just five pages daily.
- **Make the response satisfying:** Track my reading in a habit tracker app and celebrate with a small treat after completing a chapter.
# Question 9
## Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

I would like to reduce screen time on social media. To make this habit less appealing, I will:

- **Make the cue invisible:** Remove app shortcuts from my home screen.
- **Make the process unattractive:** Turn on grayscale mode to make the phone screen less appealing.
- **Make it hard:** Enable a passcode for social media apps that someone else sets.
- **Make the response unsatisfying:** Remind myself of how much more productive I am without excessive screen time and reflect on it at the end of the day.
