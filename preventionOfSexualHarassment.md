## 1. Introduction

Sexual harassment is an unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature that can create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. The impact of such harassment extends beyond individual victims to include organizational costs in terms of reduced productivity, increased turnover, and potential legal liabilities. Preventing sexual harassment is not only a legal and moral obligation but is also critical for maintaining a healthy workplace culture.

## 2. Understanding Sexual Harassment

Sexual harassment can occur in various forms, including verbal, non-verbal, and physical conduct. Common forms of harassment include but are not limited to:

- **Verbal Harassment**: Comments or jokes of a sexual nature, unwelcome flirtation, or repeated requests for dates.
- **Non-verbal Harassment**: Staring, making sexually suggestive gestures, or sharing inappropriate images.
- **Physical Harassment**: Unwanted physical contact, blocking movements, or physical assault.

### 2.1 Legal Definitions and Frameworks

Most countries have established legal definitions and frameworks aimed at preventing workplace harassment. In the United States, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, which includes harassment. Other countries have similar regulations, such as the UK’s Equality Act of 2010 and the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act in India. Compliance with these laws is essential for organizations to protect themselves and their employees.

## 3. Prevention Strategies

Preventing sexual harassment requires a proactive, multi-layered approach that includes education, clear policies, and accessible reporting mechanisms.

- **Online Modules**: Accessible resources for ongoing learning.
- **Management Training**: Special sessions for supervisors on how to handle complaints sensitively and legally.

### 3.3 Creating Reporting Mechanisms
